  "readme": "# Opal Dark Syntax for Atom\n\n> A dark, colorful, neat theme, resembling the sparkling colors of an opal, contrasted against an indigo-night editor background, with purple, cyan, orange-sherbet and pink syntax accents.\n\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/statisticallyfit/opal-dark-syntax/sample_syntax.png?raw=true)\n\n##Features\n\n1. Keywords are light, dusty pink, avoiding confusion with a red color for errors.\n2. Functions are sherbet-orange and other keywords pepper the screen with yellow and green, mimicking the cheerful quality of an opal's facets.\n3. Number constants are light violet and bolded for visibility, while reflecting the ui base accent color.\n4. Class supporter keywords are light cyan, completing the soft opal effect.\n5. Indigo-themed autocomplete dropdown list with a lighter indigo accent for even selections.\n6. Very dark indigo editor background matches the dropdown and doesn't clash with the dark-gray panel colors.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall using Atom\n\n1. Go to Atom -> Preferences...\n2. Then select the Install tab\n3. Click the Themes button to the right of the search box\n4. Enter opal-dark-syntax in the search box.\n\n#Team\n\nModified and maintained by [statisticallyfit](https://github.com/statisticallyfit/opal-dark-syntax/graphs/contributors).\n\nThis theme is based off the Dracula Theme. Work from original creators is visible [here](https://github.com/dracula/atom/graphs/contributors).\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](./LICENSE)\n",
