  "readme": "# Opal Dark Syntax for Atom\n\n> A dark, colorful, neat theme, resembling the sparkling colors of an opal, contrasted against an indigo-night editor background, with purple, cyan, orange-sherbet and pink syntax accents.\n\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/statisticallyfit/opal-dark-syntax/sample_syntax.png?raw=true)\n\n##Features\n\n1. Active and hovered tabs are underlined thickly with cyan.\n2. Larger-than normal pink circles form instead of the 'x' on modified tabs, and a large cyan 'x' flashes after saving the modified file.\n3. Gray-violet base accent colors, used for the scrollbars, button border colors, and tooltips.\n4. Scrollbars flash pink when selected and dragged, mimicking an opal's facets.\n5. Indigo-themed autocomplete dropdown list with a lighter indigo accent for even selections.\n6. Very dark indigo editor background matches the dropdown and doesn't clash with the dark-gray panel colors.\n7. Buttons flash indigo upon mouse hover, matching the indigo-patterned autocomplete dropdown and editor background.\n8. Modified files are colored pink in the tree-view, and successfully-created files are colored soft-cyan. \n\n## Install\n\nInstall using Atom\n\n1. Go to Atom -> Preferences...\n2. Then select the Install tab\n3. Click the Themes button to the right of the search box\n4. Enter opal-dark-syntax in the search box.\n\n#Team\n\nModified and maintained by [statisticallyfit](https://github.com/statisticallyfit/opal-dark-syntax/graphs/contributors).\n\nThis theme is based off the Dracula Theme. Work from original creators is visible [here](https://github.com/dracula/atom/graphs/contributors).\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](./LICENSE)\n",
